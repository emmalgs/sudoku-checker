## Description

Worried you've got your sudoku wrong and too blind to see that you have repeat numbers in a row, column, or square? Well, take the time to plug in those numbers in this sudoku checker! It'll highlight what you got right...and what you got wrong. Used to practice TDD and Jest to develop projects.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your desktop_
* _Navigate to the root directory in your terminal and run ```$ npm install```_
* _Add any additional dependencies by running in the root directory ```$ npm install [package-name]```_
  - _include ```--save-dev``` flag if its a development dependency_
  - _list the package version if you want, for example: ```$ npm install webpack@4.46.0 --save-dev```_
  - _include ```--save-exact``` to save the exact version, for example ```$ npm install webpack@4.46.0 --save-dev --save-exact```_
* _After all packages are installed, to start the project's server, in the root directory in your terminal run ```$ npm run start```_

## Known Bugs

* _Does not check 3x3 squares...yet_
* _Highlights the entire row, does not highlight column, and does not pinpoint exact incorrect number_
